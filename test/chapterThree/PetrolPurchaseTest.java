// 3.12
// (Class PetrolPurchase) Create a class called PetrolPurchase to represent information about the petrol you purchase.
//        The class should include five pieces of information in the form of
//        instance variables—the station’s location (type String), the type of petrol (type String),
//        the quantity (type int) of the purchase in liters, the price per liter (double),
//        and the percentage discount(double).
//        Your class should have a constructor that initializes the five instance variables.
//        Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable.
//        In addition, provide a method named getPurchase-Amount that calculates the net purchase amount
//        (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per liter) minus the discount,
//        then returns the net amount you had to pay as a double value.
//        Write an application class named Petrol that demonstrates the capabilities of class PetrolPurchase.
